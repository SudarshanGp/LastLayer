LastLayer
=========

The Last Layer project is an attempt at making n-factor authenication fast and hassle free. it is primarily aimed at helping buildings become more secure by providing additional layers of authentication to building locks. The use of Last Layer is not restricted to buildings, or to any particular form of authentication. The platform is designed to be completely flexible and salable on both ends, for primary and secondary authentication options.

The project is managed by Abhishek Modi and Sudarshan Govindaprasad at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. The inspiration for the project came out the realization of how insecure the secuirty and authentcation systems for the university buildings were. Work on this idea began at MHacks IV.
