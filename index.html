<p>Our "Last Layer" project is aimed at helping buildings become more secure by providing additional layers of authentication to building locks. The use of Last Layer is not restricted to buildings, or to any particular form of authentication. The platform is designed to be completely flexible and salable on both ends, for primary and secondary authentication options.</p>

<p>For example, the primary authentication may be an RFID prox card, with the second layer being a one time password, an SMS to a computer, or even a review by another human, But this could just as easily be changed to be authenticate one online service with some other online service... or even an RFID prox card.</p>

<p>Also, there is no limitation on the number of secondary authentication methods. Add as many of the supported authentication methods as desired.</p>

<p>Thus, Last Layer attempts to grow be the final layer of automated security for any application.</p>

<a name="inspiration-for-last-layer" class="anchor" href="#inspiration-for-last-layer"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Inspiration for Last Layer</h3>

<p>This idea came about last week, when Sudarshan and I were at the new ECE building at the University of Illinois. We realized that something as insecure as RFID was scarcely okay for something as regular as the building's outer doors. Let alone the multi million dollar fabrication labs inside the building. Also, why should two rooms with very different security needs have the same security implementation. </p>

<p>We therefore took on the challenge of doing our first hardware hack. RFID + Raspberry Pi. However as we found out through the process, the choice of our RFID reader was a mistake as it wouldn't work with the pi, and we ended up writing a completely new driver just for the project.</p>
